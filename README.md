## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-weather-station-extended`
3. Gather a free developer key for Weather Underground [here](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).
4. Update your configuration file. See the samples below.

## Configuration

Add the following information to your config file. Make sure to add your API key and provide your city or postal code.

### Simple

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherStation",
		"name": "Weather Station",
		"key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"location": "78613"
	}
]
```

### Advanced

The following config contains advanced optional settings that must not be specified.

The parameter **interval** sets the interval (minutes) in which the weather will be updated from Weather Underground. The default value is 4 minutes, which fits in the maximum of 400 updates per day for free accounts.

The parameter **forecast** sets which forecasts you want to see. You can set one of these three values: none, today, 3days. The default value is 3days.

You can also use a station from the **[Personal Weather Station Network](https://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/overview.asp)** to receive weather information. Just enter pws:YOURID in the location parameter.

The parameter **serialNumber** allows you to set a custom serial number for the accessory. The default value is the value given for **location**.

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherStation",
		"name": "Weather Station",
		"interval": "4",
		"key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"location": "pws:ICALIFOR123",
		"forecast": "3days",
		"serialNumber": "123456"
	}
]
```

## Example use cases

- Switch on a blue light in the morning when the chance for rain is above 20% today (or white when the forecast condition is snow / yellow when it's sunny).
- Start your automatic garden irrigation in the evening depending on the amount of rain today and the forecast for tomorrow.

**Hint:** To trigger rules based on time and weather condition you will need a plugin like [homebridge-delay-switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-delay-switch). Create a dummy switch that resets after some seconds. Set this switch to on with a timed rule. Then create a condition rule that triggers when the switch goes on depending on weather conditions of your choice.
